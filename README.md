# Byte-Coin-App
# The objective of this challenge is to apply the skills i learned in the Clima app and make a Bitcoin price reporter. i am going to revisit how to use URLSession to make HTTP requests and JSONDecoder for JSON parsing. 



# What i created
i am going to make a Bitcoin price ticker. The app will give you the latest Bitcoin prices in all the popular, traded currencies, so you can track how well your Bitcoin investments are doing on the go.
